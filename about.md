Hi All! You must be a bit weird like me, I click on About Me pages, too.

Professionally I do networking stuff. I've worked on all sorts of networks over the past twenty years, and right now I work on the [Sohonet Media Network]https://www.sohonet.com that interconnects most of the top film and media companies in the world. We light a lot of fiber and I do a lot of BGP and MPLS to make everything do the thing.

Personally I have a million-and-one hobbies. I try to keep it just to a few at a time, and right now I'm doing cycling and embedded electronics. I'm hoping I'll remember to share things... and complete a project (it's hard, have to get to the next hobby soon!)
