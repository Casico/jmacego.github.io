      <p>This is my website, so you'll see this on most posts. This is also a really awkward photo of me I took a couple of years ago when I thought I needed a more professional profile photo. If you'd like to know more I have an <a href="{{ '/about'  | absolute_url }}">About Me</a> section. I think it's funny.</p>
